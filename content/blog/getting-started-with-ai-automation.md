Automation doesn't have to be complicated. Here's a simple path to your first AI-powered workflow.

## Step 1: Identify repetitive tasks

Look for tasks your team does repeatedly:

- Responding to customer inquiries
- Processing invoices or receipts
- Generating reports from data

These are ideal candidates for automation.

## Step 2: Choose the right tool

Start with the AI Advisor to get familiar with AI-driven workflows.
