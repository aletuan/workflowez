## 2. Onboarding Program

### 2.1 Overview

A structured, supportive onboarding experience sets the foundation for long-term success. Workflowez's onboarding program spans **90 days**, divided into three phases:

| Phase | Timeline | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Week 1–2 | Systems, tools, culture, team introductions |
| **Phase 2: Integration** | Week 3–8 | Role-specific training, first contributions, collaboration |
| **Phase 3: Acceleration** | Week 9–13 | Independent ownership, goal-setting, feedback loops |

### 2.2 Before Day One (Pre-boarding)

HR will send the new employee a **Welcome Package** at least 5 business days before their start date, including:

- [ ] Welcome letter from the CEO
- [ ] Company overview deck and mission/values
- [ ] IT setup instructions (laptop, accounts, VPN)
- [ ] First-day schedule and who to contact
- [ ] Link to this Guide and the HR Policy
- [ ] Required pre-reading (product overview, team structure)
- [ ] Swag and welcome note (for in-office starters)

**IT will provision accounts** for all key systems before Day 1:
- Company email (Google Workspace)
- Slack workspace
- Notion (internal wiki)
- GitHub (for engineering roles)
- HR system (for leave requests, payslips)
- Relevant product/project management tools

### 2.3 Week 1–2: Foundation

**Day 1 — Welcome & Orientation:**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 9:00–9:30 | Welcome meeting with HR — paperwork, access, Q&A |
| 9:30–10:30 | 1-on-1 with direct manager — role overview, 30-day goals |
| 10:30–12:00 | Team introduction meeting |
| 13:00–14:00 | Product demo and company pitch walkthrough |
| 14:00–15:00 | IT orientation — tools, security, VPN setup |
| 15:00–17:00 | Self-directed: explore Notion wiki, Slack channels, documentation |

**Week 1–2 Activities:**
- Complete mandatory compliance training (security awareness, data privacy, AI usage policy)
- Meet all direct team members via scheduled 30-minute "coffee chats"
- Review product documentation and competitive landscape overview
- Set up local development environment (engineering) or workspace tools (other roles)
- Attend first team standup and weekly all-hands

### 2.4 Week 3–8: Integration

During this phase, the new employee transitions from observer to active contributor:

- **Week 3–4:** Take on a first project or task (designed to be achievable and confidence-building)
- **Week 5–6:** Expand scope; participate in cross-functional meetings and projects
- **Week 7–8:** Deliver first meaningful output; mid-probation review with manager

**Integration milestones:**
- Complete role-specific technical/functional training modules (see Section 4)
- Attend at least 2 internal Tech Talks or knowledge-sharing sessions
- Complete AI Tool Usage training (see Section 5)
- Have 1-on-1 with at least 3 cross-functional colleagues

### 2.5 Week 9–13: Acceleration

By week 9, the employee should be operating with increasing independence:

- Set personal OKRs for the current quarter (with manager guidance)
- Begin Individual Development Plan (IDP) — see Section 7
- Take full ownership of assigned projects with appropriate support
- Provide onboarding feedback to HR (what worked, what can improve)
- End-of-probation review at week 13 (or as scheduled per HR Policy)

### 2.6 Onboarding Buddy Program

Every new employee is assigned an **Onboarding Buddy** — a peer (not their manager) from the same or adjacent team. The buddy's role is to:

- Be the go-to person for informal questions and cultural nuances
- Check in daily during Week 1, weekly through Week 8
- Share "how things really work" beyond the official documentation
- Help the new employee feel welcome and connected

Buddies are volunteers, selected and briefed by HR before the new hire's start date.

---

## 3. Training Philosophy & Principles

### 3.1 Core Principles

Workflowez's approach to learning is guided by four principles:

**1. Learning in the Flow of Work**
The most effective learning happens on the job. We design training to be practical, immediately applicable, and integrated with real work — not just classroom exercises.

**2. Autonomy with Accountability**
Employees are trusted to manage their own learning journey. The Company provides resources, time, and budget. Employees are accountable for using them purposefully and connecting growth to their role.

**3. Peer Learning Over Top-Down Instruction**
Some of our best teachers are internal. We invest in creating opportunities for team members to share expertise with each other — through Tech Talks, pair programming, code review, and documentation.

**4. AI-Augmented Learning**
As an AI company, we embrace AI tools as learning accelerators. Employees are encouraged to use approved AI tools to explore concepts, generate practice problems, summarize research, and get instant feedback.

### 3.2 The 70-20-10 Model

Workflowez structures learning investment according to the 70-20-10 model:

| Channel | Share | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **On-the-job experience** | 70% | Challenging projects, stretch assignments, new responsibilities |
| **Social learning** | 20% | Mentoring, coaching, peer feedback, shadowing |
| **Formal learning** | 10% | Courses, workshops, certifications, structured programs |

This model ensures that training is grounded in real work rather than theoretical study alone.

## 7. Individual Development Plans (IDP)

### 7.1 What is an IDP?

An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a personal roadmap — co-created by the employee and their manager — that outlines:
- Where the employee wants to grow (skills, knowledge, career direction)
- What specific actions they will take to get there
- What support the Company will provide
- How progress will be measured

IDPs are not performance reviews. They are forward-looking development conversations.

### 7.2 Who Creates an IDP?

All full-time employees are encouraged to create an IDP. It becomes a standing agenda item in monthly 1-on-1s. Employees new to the Company create their first IDP during the **Week 9–13 onboarding phase** (Acceleration Phase).

### 7.3 IDP Structure

A Workflowez IDP typically covers:

**Section 1: Career Aspirations (6–18 months)**
- What role or type of work do you want to move toward?
- What does success look like in your current role?
- What are your longer-term career interests?

**Section 2: Current Strengths**
- What skills and capabilities do you bring today?
- What recent accomplishments are you most proud of?

**Section 3: Development Areas**
- What 2–3 skills or competencies will you focus on in the next 6 months?
- Why are these important for your growth and for the Company?

**Section 4: Action Plan**
| Development Goal | Actions | Resources Needed | Target Date | Success Measure |
|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| e.g., Improve system design skills | Take O'Reilly system design course; lead architecture review on Project X | O'Reilly access, time allocation | Month 3 | Delivered architecture doc reviewed and approved by Tech Lead |

**Section 5: Manager Support**
- What specific support do you need from your manager?
- What stretch assignments or new experiences would help your growth?

### 7.4 IDP Review Cadence

| Frequency | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Monthly | Review IDP progress in 1-on-1; adjust actions as needed |
| Semi-annual | Full IDP review aligned with performance review cycle |
| Annually | Create or refresh IDP for the next year |

IDPs are stored in Notion (individual employee folders) and are visible only to the employee and their manager.

---

## 10. Internal Knowledge Sharing

### 10.1 Tech Talks

**Bi-weekly, 30–45 minutes, open to all employees**

Tech Talks are internal presentations where any team member can share knowledge about:
- A technical topic, architecture decision, or system design challenge
- A new tool, framework, or AI model they've been exploring
- A customer problem and how it was solved
- Lessons learned from a project or experiment

**How to propose a Tech Talk:**
1. Post a topic suggestion in the **#tech-talks** Slack channel
2. HR or the Tech Talk coordinator will schedule a slot
3. Prepare a brief (5–10 slide) deck or live demo
4. Recordings are stored in Notion for employees who couldn't attend

### 10.2 Learning Lunches

**Monthly, 60 minutes, informal**

Learning Lunches are informal group discussions around a topic or challenge relevant to the team. Unlike Tech Talks, these are conversational — no deck required. Topics can include:
- How to approach a recurring workflow challenge
- Exploring a new methodology or framework (e.g., Jobs-to-be-Done, Shape Up)
- Sharing experiences from a conference or workshop
- Open Q&A with a team lead or executive

### 10.3 Internal Documentation Culture

---

## 12. Employee Support Programs

### 12.1 Employee Assistance Program (EAP)

All full-time employees have access to the **Employee Assistance Program**, providing:

- Up to **6 free, confidential counseling sessions per year** with a licensed professional
- Access to a 24/7 support helpline for urgent emotional or mental health concerns
- Resources for stress management, anxiety, work-life balance, and personal challenges
- Referral to longer-term care if needed (cost-sharing arrangements available)

To access the EAP, employees contact the EAP provider directly (details on the internal HR portal). All EAP interactions are strictly confidential — HR and management do not have access to individual sessions or usage data.

### 12.2 Manager Support & Coaching

Employees experiencing challenges in their role — whether technical, interpersonal, or related to role clarity — are encouraged to:

1. **Talk to their manager** in the next scheduled 1-on-1 or request an ad-hoc conversation
2. **Contact HR** if the issue involves their manager or is sensitive in nature
3. **Request a 3-way conversation** (employee + manager + HR) for complex situations

Managers are trained to provide supportive, solution-focused responses. Employees should never feel they must "wait for the annual review" to raise challenges.

### 12.3 Flexible Work Arrangements

In addition to the standard hybrid policy, employees experiencing temporary personal challenges (illness, caregiving responsibilities, etc.) may request temporary flexible work arrangements, including:

- Adjusted start/end times within the core-hours window
- Temporary increase in remote days
- Compressed work weeks (subject to role requirements)

Such arrangements are agreed in writing with the manager and HR, and reviewed monthly.

### 12.4 Return-to-Work Support

Employees returning from extended leave (maternity, paternity, medical, or personal leave) will receive a structured **re-integration support plan**, including:

- A re-onboarding session with HR on their return date (updated policies, team changes, systems updates)
- A meeting with their manager to re-establish priorities and expectations
- A reduced workload or transition period for the first 2–4 weeks, as agreed
- Access to the EAP if needed for personal adjustment support

### 12.5 Peer Support Network

Workflowez encourages the formation of informal **employee resource groups (ERGs)** and peer support communities, including:
- Women in Tech group
- Mental Health & Wellness circle
- Parents & Caregivers network
- International & cross-cultural exchange group

ERGs are employee-led. HR provides a small budget (VND 2,000,000/quarter per group) for events and activities. HR does not manage or supervise ERG content.

---

## 13. Training Effectiveness & Tracking

### 13.1 Tracking Completion

All mandatory training completions are tracked in the HR system. Managers receive monthly reports showing their team's compliance status. Employees can view their own training record at any time in the HR portal.

### 13.2 Measuring Learning Impact

Beyond completion tracking, Workflowez measures learning effectiveness through:

- **Reaction (Level 1):** Post-training feedback surveys (satisfaction, relevance, quality)
- **Learning (Level 2):** Knowledge checks built into online training modules
- **Behavior (Level 3):** Manager observation and 1-on-1 discussions on skill application
- **Results (Level 4):** Correlation of development investments with performance review outcomes and team-level OKR achievement

HR reviews aggregate learning data quarterly and shares insights with the Leadership Team.

### 13.3 Feedback & Continuous Improvement

Workflowez is committed to continuously improving its training and support programs. Employees can provide feedback via:

- Post-training surveys (sent automatically after each module)
- Quarterly People Pulse survey (includes questions on learning and development)
- Direct feedback to HR at hr@workflowez.com
- Anonymous feedback via the Company's designated feedback channel

All feedback is reviewed by HR and shared (in aggregate) with the Leadership Team for program improvements.
