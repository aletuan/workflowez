## 1. Introduction & Scope

### 1.1 Company Overview

Workflowez is an early-stage AI technology company dedicated to building intelligent workflow automation solutions for businesses. We believe that automation, powered by artificial intelligence, can fundamentally transform how teams work — reducing friction, improving efficiency, and enabling people to focus on what matters most.

Our team of approximately 50 employees operates across Vietnam and internationally, united by a shared commitment to innovation, customer value, and continuous learning.

### 1.2 Purpose of This Policy

This Human Resources Policy ("Policy") establishes the standards, rights, and responsibilities that govern the employment relationship between Workflowez ("the Company") and its employees ("Employee" or "you"). It is designed to:

- Provide clear, consistent guidance on employment conditions and workplace conduct
- Ensure compliance with applicable Vietnamese labor law and relevant international regulations
- Protect the rights and well-being of all employees
- Foster a productive, inclusive, and ethical workplace culture

### 1.3 Scope

This Policy applies to all full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors of Workflowez, regardless of location (Vietnam or overseas), role, or seniority level. Where local laws of other jurisdictions apply to employees based outside Vietnam, the Company will comply with those local requirements, and this Policy should be read accordingly.

### 1.4 Policy Updates

Workflowez reserves the right to amend, update, or replace this Policy at any time. Employees will be notified of material changes with reasonable advance notice. The most current version of this Policy is always available on the Company's internal HR portal. Continued employment after a policy update constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

## 6. Equity & ESOP

### 6.1 Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)

Workflowez believes that employees should share in the long-term value they help create. The Company operates an **Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)** through which eligible employees receive options to purchase shares in the Company at a pre-determined exercise price.

### 6.2 Eligibility

ESOP grants are available to:
- Full-time permanent employees at the level of Senior and above
- Key contributors as identified by the CEO and Board, at their discretion

New employee ESOP grants are typically issued as part of the offer package for qualifying roles. Additional grants may be awarded for exceptional performance or at company funding milestones.

Vesting is contingent on continuous employment. Unvested options are forfeited upon termination, subject to the terms of the individual option agreement.

### 6.4 Exercise & Liquidity

Options may be exercised during designated exercise windows, subject to the Company's share option plan rules.

### 6.5 Good Leaver / Bad Leaver Provisions

- **Good Leavers** (resignation with proper notice, redundancy, retirement) retain vested options for 90 days post-termination
